# Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number' in TypeScript

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript where a string is passed to a function that expects a number. The TypeScript compiler catches this error during compilation, preventing runtime errors.  The solution shows how to address this by using type guards or explicit type conversion.
